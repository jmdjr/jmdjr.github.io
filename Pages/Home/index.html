<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This website will introduce you my skills and experience as a software developer.</p>

<p>As of right now, It is incomplete.  this is simply because I am still working on it!  I have some interesting concepts for it, and will get work done on it periodically. It will be implemented to be fully responsive and minimalistic, enough to show off what I can do.</p>

<p>This site is a amalgamation of several technologies, some of which I had no prior knowledge of before working on this particular site.</p>
