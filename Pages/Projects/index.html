		<h3>Pixelship 9000</h3>
		<p>This game... was difficult to make.  Though the other two members of the team were good people, we all were struggling with making decisions as to how the game should turn out. everyone had different opinions, and only one of us was capable of producing meaningful content.  eventually in a bout of frustration, I published the game to kongregate. the other members didn't want it published because of how shoddy the work was, but I thought it was fine just the way it was.</p>
		<p>If the either your computer doesn't allow flash to work, or
		kongregate didn't like me running my game from their server. either way, you
		can access this game from the following url.</p>

		<h3>JD Bacon - The Game</h3>
			<p> This project was strange. I was pulled in by a struggling team, of which had already sunk a whole year into production, to help them try and save the game. The team consisted of friends I met while testing at Volt, and whom previously turned me down when I offered to help.  after reviewing their game design, it became apparent they were being very ambitious for their first game.</p><p>Long story - Ultimately, many members left the team due to personal reasons and the project was dropped.</p>

		<h3>JD Bacon Ammo Shack Survival (unofficial title)</h3>
		<p>After the first project flop, my team was eager to get something done. I proposed a simpler game concept and work resumed. After sinking in another 6 months into this project, the team ran into the same issues it did in the first project; people losing interest and personal lives.</p></div>
